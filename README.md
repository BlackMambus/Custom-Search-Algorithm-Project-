# Custom-Search-Algorithm-Project-

A custom search algorithm defines your own logic to find, filter, and rank dataâ€”whether it's from web pages, databases, documents, or app content. Unlike general-purpose engines like Google, it focuses on domain-specific needs and can optimize speed, relevance, or personalization.
